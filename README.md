# ObjectOrientedClickGame

This game was created for a course project. We worked toward fully utilizing object oriented code to create different game features. 

OBJECTIVE:
    Click on the DARK BLUE bubble and you win the game!
    
RULES:
    If you click on any other bubble than the  DARK BLUE bubble,
    you will lose the game. If you click on the DARK BLUE bubble, 
    the game will end as the game has been one.
CHALLENGE:
    There will are a few other bubbles on the screen. Each bubble 
    will move sporadically and quickly making them hard to catch. 
    Watch out for the distraction squares. If you click them, they will 
    get larger making the winning bubble harder to catch.
INTERACTION:
    The player must click on the correct DARK BLUE bubble in order
    to win the game!
HOW THE GAME IS TAILORED:
    I tailored the color choice to my bubbles using coolors.io. The most common type of color blindness is red/green.
    I used the "glasses" feature on coolors to create a palette that would yield easily distinguishable 
    colors for to include this group of users. I used dark blue as that was a close match between this type of 
    color blindness and non-color blind folks in terms of visibility and similarity in how the blue appears.
